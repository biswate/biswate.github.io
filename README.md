# Biswajit Karmakar

Hi! My name is Biswajit Karmakar.   

I am  a researcher in theoritical high energy physics  [group](https://czastki.us.edu.pl/) at Institute of  Physics, [University of Silesia](https://us.edu.pl/) in Katowice,  Poland. Since March 2022, I am a coporation associate (COAS) member of  [CERN](https://www.home.cern/), Switzerland. 

Previously, I completed my [PhD](http://gyan.iitg.ernet.in/handle/123456789/917) from the [Indian Institute of Technology  Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). For my post-docs, I have spent my times at the [Physical Research Laboratory](https://www.prl.res.in/prl-eng/)  Ahmedabad, India; [Institute of High Energy Physics](http://english.ihep.cas.cn/), Beijing, China and  [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/), India respectively.  

## Research Areas

**Theoritical high energy physics** is my broad area of research with particular emphasis on **neutrino physics, extended scalar sector, matter-antimatter, dark matter, cosmology** including various **non-standard models, collider physics.** 




## Publications 
So far I have 13 regular articles and 1  review article  in reputated physics journals.  Detailed list of my publications can obtained from [inspirehep](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1503342).
