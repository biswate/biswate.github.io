# Biswajit Karmakar
Hi! My name is Biswajit Karmakar.  I am  a researcher in Theoritical High Energy Physics   at Institute of  Physics, Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach,  Poland. I completed my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology  Guwahati. Then I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Physical Research Laboratory  Ahmedabad, India, and at the Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing, China. Before moving to Katowice, I was a researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad.  

High energy physics phenomenology is my broad area of research with particular emphasis on neutrino physics, dark matter, cosmology, etc.
